Open Delivery Network
===================

<p>The Open Delivery Network is a set of public protocols to create an autonomous vehicle infrastructure for logistics.</p>
<p>We see the most viable way of increasing the efficiency of logisitics and enable and empowering the most people in the world.  An open network and compatible set of standards could be a better system than an Amazon/Google controlled network. </p>

The network is composed of 3 parts.

<ul>
	<li>Network of charging/routing/package handling stations</li>
	<li>Decentralized routing protocol - think bitcoin with charging/routing stations equivelent to miners</li>

</ul>

Initial Project
==================
Build a common charging and vertical take off and landing system for any common UAV. 

Composed of:
<ul>
	<li>Common charging connector</li>
	<li>Docking station</li>
	<li>Landing control system</li>
	<li>Software APIs to build autonomous scheduling</li>
</ul>
